# Java Kit

## Files
- `Agent.java` is located under `src/main/java/com/elementai`
- It is suggested you go over `Player.java` under `src/main/java/com/elementai/element` to understand the properties you may access as a player.
- Do *not* change any of the files that come pre-packaged with the environment excpet for `Agent.java`. We cannot guarantee your bot will work if you do.

## Compiling and Running

You *must* compile your bot in order to use it. To compile and run,
1. run `bash make-jar.sh`
   - Note: you must run this *every* time you make a change
   - Note: this script can be run from anywhere successfully so long as the path is correct
2. enter the path to `main.py` when you run the environment
