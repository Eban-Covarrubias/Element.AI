# Python Kit

The Python Kit works mostly out-of-the-box. When running the environment, enter the path to the `main.py` file of your kit as shown in the main README.md A few important notes:

1. **Do not edit *any* of** `main.py` or `tools/*`. If you do, your submission will be nonfunctional and will likely lose all its matches.
2. You may freely edit `agent.py` or create other files as you wish.
