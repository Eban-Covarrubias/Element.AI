# Element.AI Submission and Evaluation

## Submission
The submission portal is available at [https://128.54.69.221:3000/competitions/Element.AI](https://128.54.69.221:3000/competitions/Element.AI).

## Evaluation
During the competition when submissions are open, we will run a live, trueskill ranked leaderboard that uses every team's latest verified submission. After 6:30PM we will use the leaderboard to seed a double elimination knockout bracket and crown winners based on the results of that.
